## What is R package development?

Process of 

* writing code in a standardized framework.
* writing code for generic use.

## Why should I develop an R Package?

Tell me why :-) 

## Why should I develop an R Package?

Standard way of 

* documenting
* testing
* distributing

code

## What is a package (states)?

* source code (when you create it).
* built package (what you save to your disk with `install.pacakges()`).

## What is a package (source code)?

A directory with a few files / folders:

* DESCRIPTION (meta info)
* NAMESPACE (import / export)
* R/ (your functions)
* man/ (your documentation)
* vignettes/ (long form documentation)
* tests/ (tests)
* data/ (your data)


## Creating a package (skeleton)

Let's do it together. 

* `> usethis::create_package("testpkg")`

Done :-) 

## A few basic things about using Rstudio

* go to file/function.
* file browser.
* break points and `browser()`
* Command history (arrow + recursive search).


## Clean-up

* enable markdown support `Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)`. This will allow you
  to use markdown syntax.
* adapt DESCRIPION to your specific needs.
  
## Intermezzo: Markdown syntax

* `[label](https://...)` for web-links
* `[fun()]` for cross-references
* \`code\` for code font.
* stars /numbers with dots for enumerations.
* ...


## Framework for package development

We are going to use the devtools framework with uses the following R packages:

* `roxygen2` for in line documentation.
* `testthat` for unit tests.
* `usethis` for common non-coding, manipulating, editing tasks.

## roxygen

* Special comments `#'` we use in source code are called roxygen comments.
* `roxygen2` extracts those and creates documentation in `man/` for you. The
  file format of the documentation is `.Rd`.
* Alternative: learn latex-like language and write plain `.Rd`.

## Adding a function to your package

* `usethis::use_r("my-file-name")` to create a new file `my-file-name.R` in `R/`.
* Create a function. I suggest
`add_two_numbers <- function(x, y) {`

  `  sum(x, y)`

`}`

* Suggest to name files by context, not by function.
* Can have multiple function declarations in one file.
* `R/` is only for declarations, no top-level function calls.
* Exception: Obviously in function declarations, you can have calls. 

## Adding a function to your package

* How can I use this function interactively? -> Workflow

## Intermezzo: Namespaces

* Every object in R is defined in a "context".
* The order of the namespaces on the search path defines where `R` will look 
  for an object first.
* What does `search()`?
* You probably used the global namespace so far.
* What happens when you call `library()`?
* Every package a name space.
* That's why you can redefine `var()` and `sd()` is unaffected (Why?).


## Workflow

* Edit a file.
* Run `devtools::load_all()`. Just updates the package namespace.
* Don't put anything in the global name space, e.g. via `source`.
* Run `devtools::document()` to generate `.Rd` from roxygen comments.

## devtools::load_all()

* This updates the namespace in your current R session. 
* You don't change the package in the place where you have all your other 
  packages stored.
* For this reason: (i) it is much faster than building the package with 
  `devtools::build()` and (ii) it is not available in other R sessions.


## Adding a function to your package

* How can I use this function as a "usual" R package in any R session?
* Need to build the package.


## NAMESPACE stuff

* decide whether you want function to be exported (=available for the end user) 
  (roxygen tag `@export`).
* if you need functions from other packages: `usethis::use_package("pkgname")`.
  This will add package to DESCRIPTION.
* then, refer to the function from the package with `pkgname::fun()`.
* Alternative: Refer to package with `fun()` and add roxygen tag 
  `@importFrom packagename fun`. This will add package and function to NAMESPACE.
* You can often use a roxygen comment to refer to multiple "things". I.e. 
  `@importFrom pkgname fun1 fun2 fun3`.

## Documentation

* Example: `style_pkg()` from the `styler` package.
* Compare (i) rendered .Rd with `styler::style_pkg()` with (ii) the source at
https://github.com/r-lib/styler/blob/master/R/ui.R#L6

Structure:

* Title 
* two lines blank
* description
* @param x,y Vectors.
* @export
* @examples


## Documentation

Other useful roxygen tags:

* @inheritParams
* @seeAlso
* @family
* ...

Start at this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) (has a some non-markdown syntax in there like `\code{x}`, just use it for the tags).

## Testing (basic idea)

```{r, out.width="65%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("r-pkgs-tutorial/img/meme-dangerously.jpg"))
```


## Testing (basic idea)

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("r-pkgs-tutorial/img/meme-sleep.jpg"))
```

## Testing (basic idea)

* Why? Complexity grows exponentially with internal dependencies.
* test whether your function returns what you expect.
* I.e. match result of function call with reference.


## Testing (basic idea)

* Example with `add_two_numbers()`?
* unit testing -> test (small) units.
* fail fast.
* high coverage (-> `covr` package)


## Testing (Setting up)

* tests life in `tests/`
* we use the package testthat for unit testing.
* `usethis::use_testthat()` to add infrastructure

## Testing (adding a test)

* `usethis::use_test("testname")` adds a test file in `tests/testthat`
* all testthat test file names start with `test-`.

## Testing (writing tests)

* `context()`: Useful when running tests to see which one fail / succeed.
* `test_that("x y z returns correct number of rows", [code]).
* Form sentences for easy understanding: 
  "Test that x y z returns correct number of rows"

## Testing (testing functions)

* most testthat functions start with `expect_`.
* `expect_silent()`
* `expect_s3class()`
* `expect_equal()` 
* `expect_true()`
* `expect_known_value()` (use git ! or `update = FALSE`)
* ...
* `skip_*()` to skip a test if a condition holds.

## How to run tests

* Cmd+Shift+T or build tab.
* Note that default working directory of for tests is not root directory 
  of package.
* Using `testthat::test_path()` package to find these files.

* Then, in tests, refer to files relative to testtthat directory as follows:
* `expect_equal_to_references(my_object, test_path("reference-objects/ref-1"))`


## Adding data

* `usethis::use_data(dataset)` adds data with the name `dataset`.

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("r-pkgs-tutorial/img/data-roxygen.png"))
```



## Putting it all together: R CMD CHECK

Asserts a whole range of things, in particular: 

* documentation matches code (all arguments documented).
* all unit tests pass.
* package can be installed
* ...

Run `devtools::check()` (or simply Ctrl+Shift+E)


## Let's make your package pass R CMD CHECK

Iterative process of 

* running `devtools::check()`.
* fixing errors, warnings, notes.


## Using continuous integration

Can run R CMD check locally, but also on fresh copy of 

* Linux / mac (with Travis)
* Windows (with AppVeyor)

`usethis::use_tidy_ci()`

## More add ons

* `covr` for code coverage reports.
* slack notifications etc.

An example: www.github.com/r-lib/styler

## Vignettes

* Long for documentation.
* `usethis::use_vignette("vignette-title")`
* can be found via package index.
* build vignettes into `inst/` with `devtools::build_vignettes()`


## pkgdown 

* Package to create nice html documentation from your source code.
* can be hosted on GitHub.

An example: www.github.com/r-lib/styler

## Releases

* Why releases?
* Suggested form: `major.minor.patch`, e.g. `0.1.2`
* Change in `DESCRIPTION`


## Putting your package on GitHub

Last weeks course: 

1. initialize GitHub repo locally.
2. Create repo on GitHub
3. Go back to command line and push.

or `usethis::use_github()`

## Installing from GitHub

`remotes::install_github("[username]/[repo]")`, e.g.
`remotes::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr")`.
