```

## Today's plan

* first hour: Theory + group practice.
* second hour: (optional participation): Training problems, general questions.
* This is really just the basics.

## What is git?

* A version control system (VCS).
* smart way of storing file histories.
* Created to version the linux kernel.
* builds a tree of all changes.
* A change stored in the VCS = a commit.
* Every commit has a hash as an id.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="650px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/git-tree.png"))
```

## Inspecting differences


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="750px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/git-diff.png"))
```


## Basic workflow

* workflow: change -> save -> add to index -> commit (-> push)
* importatn: saved not = commited not = pushed

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="750px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/git-states.png"))
```


## Why git?

Tell me why :-) 

## Why git?
* end your copy / paste / save code as backup workflow.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="650px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/c-p-hell.png"))
```

* understand **what** and **why** you did something in restrospect.
* collaborating with others.
* restoring previous versions.
* and more.

## How can I use git?

* local GUI (e.g. Rstudio git tab).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/git-gui.png"))
```

* command line.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="350px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/git-cmd.png"))
```

* web GUI (e.g. GitHub).

## Pros and Cons

* Rstudio git tab: + easy to learn, - limited functionality
* command line: + very flexible, + "native git", - more
  difficult to learn than other methods.
* GitHub: + good collaboration / communication, - not
  actual coding

## git with RStudio (create project)

* create new RStudio Project (otherwise you can't use the git GUI)
* check "create git repository"
* call it ethz-git-with-rstudio

## git with RStudio (create files)

* create a new R script.
* put some example code there.
* I suggest

`add_two_numbers <- function(x, y) {`

  `  sum(x, y)`

`}`


`add_numbers(1, 2)`

* save file as `test-gui.R`

## git with RStudio (add files)

* have a look at the git tab 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/rstudio-git.png")) 
```

## git with RStudio
You have three files there: 

* `ethz-git-with-rstudio.Rproj` (project settings) 
* `.gitignore`
* `test-gui.R`

## Intermezzo: What is .gitigore?

* A plain text file.
* lists files / folders you want to ignore from being tracked by git, one line 
  per file.
* advanced stuff: removing file from git / complicated inclusion / exclusion 
  rules.

## git with RStudio (status of files)

* yellow question mark: untracked by git.
* blue "M": modified.
* red "D": deleted.

## git with RStudio (menu items)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="750px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/rstudio-git-menu.png"))
```

Important for now:

* Diff: compare working dir with HEAD
* Commit: Add changes to tree.
* clock: History (changelog)

## git with RStudio (adding and committing)

* check boxes of you files.
* Inspect differences with "Diff".
* Commit them.

## Intermezzo: Good commits (messages)

* Do you think "update test-gui.R" is a good commit message? Why / why not?

## Intermezzo: Good commits (message)

Example of good commit messages:
* "add missing value analyis to script"
* "remove unused code"

## Intermezzo: Good commits (content)

* make small commits. 
* changes should be self-contained, minimally complete.
* all changes introduced with a commit should be related to each other.


## git with RStudio (adding and committing)

* Review your commit (how?)

## git with RStudio

* Improve `add_two_numbers` to ignore missing input values (how?).
* Commit it with a reasonable commit message.
* Again, review your commit (how?).

## from GUI to command line

* repeat what we just did on the command line. 
* but with a new repo.
* can also mingle GUI and command line approache (that's what happens in 
  practice).
* will learn stuff we could not do with the GUI.

## git with the command line (tips)

* use tab to auto-complete file names.
* use star (*) to refer to everyting.
* I use `$` to refer to terminal commands.

## git with the command line (intitialization)

* create a new folder ethz-git-with-rstudio in your home directory.
* navigate there with the command line.
* `$git init`

=> Other ways to create a repo: `$git clone`, see later.

## git with the command line (adding files)

* `$touch test.R` to create empty file.
* add some text & save.
* `$git status`

## git with the command line (stage and commit)

*`$git add test-cmd.R`
* could also do `$git add *` to add all.
* check the status (how?).
* `$git commit -m "[commit message here]"`

## git with the command line (review commits)

* `$git log`
* `$git log -p`
* `$git log --stat`
* etc.

## Commit messages and descriptions

* You now know: `$git commit -m "message"`
* But you can also: `$git commit -m "[message]" -m "[description]"`
* Idea behind description: More verbose and detailed comment on the commit.
* If you need a long (potentially multi-line) description, use a text editor as
  follows:
* Open text editor for the commit message with `$git commit`
 
## Intermezzo: Using a text editor

* How many people have used a text editor like vim or emacs?
* You can now edit the commit message.
* To enter the `insert` mode, press `i`
* First write the commit message, then leave one line blank and write a 
 description.
* When done, hit `ESC`
* Hit `:` (probably `Shift + .` on your keyboard)
* Then, type `wc` (for write and quit)
* Type `cq` to cancel and quit.
* Hit `ENTER` to confirm.

We'll come back to that.

## Commit messages and descriptions

* If you are using the RStudio tab, you can also write the message on the first
  line, then leave one line blank and write the description.

## Remote repositories (basics)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "750px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/git-remotes.gif"))
```

* a remote repo is "just another copy" of a repo (potentially in a different
  state).
* remote not the same as a branch! 
* Never mind about branches we will always use `master`
* Different branches represent different trees (and can contain different 
  commits).
  
## Remote repositories (basics)

* clone: "Download" a whole repository.
* push: Send your changes to a server.
* pull: "Download" new changes from the server.

## git with RStudio (menu items)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="750px"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("git-tutorial/img/rstudio-git-menu.png"))
```

New important menu items: 

* Pull .
* Push.

But where to push / pull from?

## Remote repositories (basics)

Two scenarios: 

* You have a repo and want to push it somewhere.
* There is a repo somewhere and you want to pull it.

We'll use GitHub as the server that hosts our remote repository.

## Remote repositories (GitHub)

* Hosts code (essentially the .git folder).
* Hosts issues / conversations / reference etc.
* is a git GUI.
* free account: All repos public (student exception)
* alternative: Bitbucket (offers free private repos)

Let's have a look: https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr

## Remote repositories (GitHub)

Two scenarios:

* There is a repo somewhere and you want to *pull* it.
* You have a repo and want to *push* it somewhere.

Either way, go to GitHub first.

## Remote repositories (pull)

* fork: Add a remote copy to yu GitHub account (without downloading)
* clone your fork: "Download" your copy with `$git clone [url]`, e.g.
  `$git clone github.com/lorenzwalthert/styler`

## Remote repositories (push)

* Go to github.com.
* click "New Repository".
* Follow the instructions by c/p into terminal.
* reload github.com
=> Success?

## Remote repositories (push)

* You just used `$git remote add [name of the remote] [url]`
* Your remote is usually called `origin`
* If there is a main repo that you forked before you cloned, it is usually called
  it `upstream`
* `git push --set-origin master` maps your `master` branch to the `master` in 
  the remote branch and pushes the repo there.


## GitHub

You can 
* open issues. 
* open pull requets (ask the maintainer of a repo to pull your changes).
* merge branches 
* etc. 

=> Self study.

## Restoring previous versions

* Soft version: Revert (= undo *a* commit) = add a new commit on top of the 
  tree.
* Hard version: Reset *to* a commit. Change your working diectory to a
  state of the tree.


## Soft version (= Revert)

* every commit has an id (= hash)
* see which commit has which hash with `$git log`
* use `$git revert [hash]`
* This will open your default text editor (probably VIM or VI by default).


## Intermezzo: Using a text editor

* You can now edit the commit message.
* To enter the `insert` mode, press `i`
* You can now edit the commit message.
* When done, hit `ESC`
* Hit `:` (probably `Shift + .` on your keyboard)
* Then, type `wc` (for write and quit)
* Type `cq` to cancel and quit.
* Hit `ENTER` to confirm.

## Soft version (= Revert)

Done. See your changes (how?)

## Hard version (=Reset)

* every commit has an id (= hash).
* see which commit has which hash with `$git log`
* use `$git reset [hash] --hard` to reset a repo to that state.

## Restoring previous versions

* You can also discard all changes in your working directory and return to the
  last commit you made: 
* `$git reset HEAD --hard`.
* In Rstudio git tab. Right click on file -> revert.

## Undo a `$git reset`

* Thank God you can.
* `$git log` shows commits in your tree.
* you can see all your actions (i.e. also commits you removed from your tree) 
  with `$git reflog`.
* You removed the second commit from your tree before when you used 
  `$git reset`. So how can you restore the state at the second commit?

## Undo a `$git reset`

* find the hash with `$git reflog`.
* use `$git reset [hash] --hard`

## More to explore

* `$git stash` / `$git stash pop` temporarily discard changes in working dir.
* `$git merge` / `$git rebase`.
* `$git branch` to switch between different branches.
* `$git rebase -i`. Interactive rebase (reorder commit, squash them together).
* `$git cherry-pick`. Add an arbitrary commit to your tree.
* `$git tag`. Anchor commits with tags.
* `$git diff` (between versions / between files). Hint: Configure a diff tool 
  like merge diff.
